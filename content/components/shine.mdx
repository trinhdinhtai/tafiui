      keyframes: {
        shine: {
         from: {
            opacity: "0",
            transform:
              "translate(0%,-100%) scale(0.5) skew(-5deg) translate3d(0, 0, 0)",
          },
          to: {
            opacity: "1",
            transform:
              "translate(150%,-50%) scale(1) skew(-25deg) translate3d(0, 0, 0)",
          },
        },
      },
      animation: {
       shine: "shine 2s ease forwards",

export default function Shine({ children }: { children?: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <div className="relative flex h-full w-full items-center justify-center overflow-hidden">
      {children}
      <div className="animate-shine absolute top-[calc(-10%)] z-10 h-[calc(70%)] w-5 bg-white/30 blur-2xl md:h-[calc(90%)] md:w-8"></div>
